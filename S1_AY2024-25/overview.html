    <h1>ST5207: Nonparametric Regression (Module Outline)</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Qingwei Liu, Email: liu_qw@nus.edu.sg</li>
        <li><strong>Module description:</strong> The basic idea of nonparametric inference is to use data to infer an unknown quantity with as few assumptions as possible. This course is designed to introduce students to smoothing methods in nonparametric regressions. R will be used to demonstrate and implement the techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommended textbooks:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Multivariate density estimation: theory, practice, and visualization</em>, by Scott, D.~W. (2015)., second edition.</li>
                <li><em>Nonparametric and semiparametric models</em>, by Wolfgang Härdle, Axel Werwatz, Marlene Müller, and Stefan Sperlich. (2004).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both books can be downloaded from NUS Library.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Topics covered:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Histogram</li>
                <li>Kernel Density Estimation</li>
                <li>Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation</li>
                <li>General Linear Nonparametric Estimation</li>
                <li>Other Smoothing methods</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Class date and time:</strong> Lectures/tutorials are on <em>Wednesday 4-7pm</em> in LT21.</li>
        <li><strong>Assessments and Final:</strong> A long assignment is given out on Week 6. It includes topics covered in Weeks 1-6 and makes up 40% of your grades. The deadline of the assignment is in Week 9. The remaining 60% of your grades comes from a face-to-face written final exam. The majority of the questions in the final exam are on topics covered in Weeks 7-13. <strong>(Subject to changes.)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Exam date and time:</strong> 04 Dec 2024 (Wed), 9-11am.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning materials:</strong> Lecture notes are posted in Canvas before the lectures. Tutorials are discussed one week after the tutorial sheets are given out. You are strongly encouraged to try out the problems independently. Students are most welcome to contribute to the discussions. Solutions of tutorials are posted in Canvas after the discussions. Tutorials are not graded. In other words, Lecture note <b>(i)</b> and Tutorial Sheet <b>(i)</b> would be posted before the lecture in week <b>(i)</b>, while the solution of Tutorial Sheet <b>(i-1)</b> would be released after we discussed it in the tutorial class in week <b>(i)</b>.</li>
        <li><strong>Programming language:</strong> R is mainly used.</li>
        <li><strong>Office hours:</strong> If you have questions on the lectures/tutorials, you're encouraged to ask your questions via emails. Alternatively, you can make an appointment for an online meeting (via Zoom) or a face-to-face meeting.</li>
