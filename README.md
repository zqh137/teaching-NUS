## ST5207 Nonparametric Regression Semester 1, AY2024/25
Most of the materials come from a handover from Prof. Yingcun Xia, which he got from Prof. Jin-Ting Zhang. 

I rewrite the lecture slides based on the materials and some reference book, in particular 
1. *Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models*
2. *Multivariate Density Esitmation*
3. *All of Nonparametric Statistics*
4. *Smoothing Techniques with Inplementation in S*

The material their provided to me only contains smoothing method, while I also wanna discuss about the Bootstrap method for nonparametric approach, c.f. Section 4.4 & 4.5 in Hall's book, *The Bootstrap and Edgeworth Expansion*. 

In particular, in Section 7.4-7.6 of *All of Nonparametric Statistics*, some estimators created by Stein are introduced. Personally, I'm very willing to add these contents to this graduate course.
