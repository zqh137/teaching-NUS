## ST5207 Nonparametric Regression Semester 1, AY2024/25
Most the materials come from a handover from Prof. Yingcun Xia, which he got from Prof. Jin-Ting Zhang. 
I (will) rewrite the lecture slides first. 

The material their provided to me only contains smoothing method, while I also wanna discuss about the Bootstrap method for nonparametric approach, c.f. Section 4.4 & 4.5 in Hall's book, *The Bootstrap and Edgeworth Expansion*.
